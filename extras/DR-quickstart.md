# pi2s3 Disaster Recovery Quickstart

Restore a full Pi backup from S3 onto new hardware in under 30 minutes.
Works on **WiFi only** — no ethernet required.

---

## What you need

- Spare Raspberry Pi 5 with NVMe drive installed
- microSD card (any size — 8 GB+ works)
- Mac to prepare the SD card
- Cloudflare tunnel for the new Pi (create one if you haven't — see Step 1)
- AWS credentials with read access to your S3 bucket

---

## Step 1 — Create a Cloudflare tunnel for the new Pi

Run on your Mac. Skip if you already have a tunnel.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create andrewninja-pi-qa
# Note the tunnel UUID printed — you'll need it in Step 2

# Add a DNS record in Cloudflare pointing at the tunnel:
#   CNAME: qa.andrewbaker.ninja → <TUNNEL_UUID>.cfargotunnel.com
```

---

## Step 2 — Flash + prepare the SD card

**Option A — Let prepare-sd.sh do everything (recommended):**

```bash
bash extras/firstboot/prepare-sd.sh --flash
```

This downloads Pi OS Lite ARM64, flashes it, and configures WiFi + cloudflared in one go.
Answer the prompts: SD disk, WiFi SSID/password, Pi password, tunnel UUID, CF hostname.

**Option B — Flash with Raspberry Pi Imager first, then inject:**

1. Open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Choose **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
3. In OS Customisation: set hostname, username/password, WiFi, enable SSH
4. Flash the card
5. Run:

```bash
bash extras/firstboot/prepare-sd.sh
```

This adds cloudflared to the card Pi Imager already prepared.

---

## Step 3 — Boot the Pi

1. Insert NVMe into the Pi (do this before powering on)
2. Insert the SD card
3. Power on

The Pi will:
- Connect to WiFi on first boot
- Install cloudflared from the SD card (no internet download)
- Start the Cloudflare tunnel

**Wait ~3 minutes**, then check the tunnel is healthy:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel info <TUNNEL_UUID>
# or: cloudflared tunnel list
```

---

## Step 4 — SSH in via Cloudflare

Add to `~/.ssh/config` (one-time):

```
Host qa.andrewbaker.ninja
    ProxyCommand cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
    User admin
```

Then:

```bash
ssh qa.andrewbaker.ninja
```

If `qa.andrewbaker.ninja` has a Cloudflare Access policy, your browser will open for auth on first use.

Check that the NVMe is visible:

```bash
lsblk | grep nvme
# Should show: nvme0n1  ...  disk
```

---

## Step 5 — Set up AWS credentials

```bash
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key ID, Secret, region (af-south-1), output (json)

# Verify:
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/pi-image-backup/
```

---

## Step 6 — Run the restore

```bash
curl -sL pi2s3.com/restore | bash
```

Or run directly:

```bash
sudo bash ~/pi2s3/pi-image-restore.sh \
  --device /dev/nvme0n1 \
  --host andrew-pi-5 \
  --resize \
  --yes
```

This streams the backup directly from S3. Takes ~20-30 min for a 7-8 GB backup.

---

## Step 7 — Wire up NVMe boot

After restore, run the boot-wiring script while still on the SD:

```bash
sudo bash ~/pi2s3/extras/post-restore-nvme-boot.sh
```

This:
- Fixes `/etc/fstab` PARTUUIDs for the new SD card
- Points `cmdline.txt` `root=` at the NVMe partition
- Adds `rootdelay=5` for NVMe PCIe enumeration

---

## Step 8 — Swap cloudflared to the QA tunnel

The restored NVMe contains the **production** cloudflared config. Before rebooting, swap it:

```bash
# Find where the NVMe root is mounted (from post-restore output)
RESTORE_ROOT=$(mount | awk '/nvme0n1p2/{print $3; exit}')

sudo sed -i "s/tunnel: .*/tunnel: <QA_TUNNEL_UUID>/"          "${RESTORE_ROOT}/etc/cloudflared/config.yml"
sudo sed -i "s|credentials-file:.*|credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<QA_TUNNEL_UUID>.json|" \
                                                               "${RESTORE_ROOT}/etc/cloudflared/config.yml"
sudo cp /root/.cloudflared/<QA_TUNNEL_UUID>.json               "${RESTORE_ROOT}/root/.cloudflared/"
```

---

## Step 9 — Reboot into NVMe

```bash
sudo reboot
```

The Pi will boot from NVMe, connect to WiFi, and come up on the QA CF tunnel.
SSH back in the same way: `ssh qa.andrewbaker.ninja`

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Tunnel never shows healthy | `cat /boot/firmware/pi2s3-firstboot.log` — check dpkg/systemctl errors |
| `firstrun.sh` didn't run | Check `cmdline.txt` has `systemd.run=` or re-run `prepare-sd.sh` |
| Pi won't boot from NVMe | `bash extras/recover-sd-boot.sh` (from Mac with SD card inserted) |
| AWS access denied | `aws sts get-caller-identity` — re-run `aws configure` |
| `No backups found` | Script running as sudo — fixed in v2+. Use `--host <hostname>` flag |
| NVMe not found (`lsblk`) | NVMe not seated. Check PCIe connection and reboot |

**Check the firstboot log first for any tunnel issue:**
```bash
cat /boot/firmware/pi2s3-firstboot.log
```

**Run the full diagnostic if the restore behaves unexpectedly:**
```bash
sudo bash ~/pi2s3/extras/diagnose-restore.sh
```
